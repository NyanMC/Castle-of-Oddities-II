why did i do this

This is my most recent work-in-progress SMBX2 episode. I decided to post it to GitHub for reasons that I don't even know.

The episode is about 65% complete right now. Three of five planned worlds are finished, as well as one level in world 4 and another half a level.

Credits are in abc123_credits.txt.
