why did i do this

This is my most recent work-in-progress SMBX2 episode. I decided to post it to GitHub for reasons that I don't even know.

The episode is about 85% content complete right now. Four of five planned worlds are finished, as well as 1 level in world 5.

Credits are in abc123_credits.txt.

If you would like to test this episode, clone the repository directly into your episodes folder. It requires a minimum of SMBX2 Beta 5 to launch. You can either play on the provided save file to easily test any level, or create your own to start from the beginning.
